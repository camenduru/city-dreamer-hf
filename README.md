Official demo for **[CityDreamer: Compositional Generative Model of Unbounded 3D Cities](https://github.com/hzxie/city-dreamer) (CVPR 2024).**

- 🔥 CityDreamer is a unbounded 3D city layout generator.
- 🤗 Try CityDreamer to generate photolistic 3D cities.
- ⚠️ Due to the limited computational resources at Hugging Face, this demo only generates **a single image** based on the New York City layout. If you wish to experience more comprehensive functionality, please visit the demo on [GitHub](https://github.com/hzxie/city-dreamer?tab=readme-ov-file#iterative-demo-%EF%B8%8F).
